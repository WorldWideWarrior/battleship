  <p>HTML5 version of the Battleship Game</p>
  <p>
    Battleship (also Battleships or Sea Battle[1]) is a guessing game for two players.
    It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which the players' fleets of ships (including battleships) are marked.
    The locations of the fleet are concealed from the other player.
    Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships,
    and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
